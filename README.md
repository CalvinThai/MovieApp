This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

After cloning the project, follow these steps to run it:

1. cd MovieApp
2. npm install
3. npm start

NOTE ON API:
To fetch popular movies, you will use the API from themoviedb.org.
If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key. 
In your request for a key, state that your usage will be for educational/non-commercial use. You will also need to provide some personal information to complete the request. Once you submit your request, you should receive your key via email shortly after.

In order to use this app, go to src/index.js and paste in your api key, for example:
global.key = "YOURKEYHERE"
